# MyProject2

Developed with Unreal Engine 4

# UnrealEnginePython

Using UE 4.25.3, we build this plugin from source:  https://github.com/20tab/UnrealEnginePython/. We are using python3.6, msprime version '0.6.0' and the latest version of matplotlib.

This version of the plugin has a bug in the bind_event() method. Use this issue to fix it and then build the plugin. https://github.com/20tab/UnrealEnginePython/issues/801#issue-512834898.
